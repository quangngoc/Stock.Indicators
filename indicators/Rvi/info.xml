    The Relative Vigor Index (RVI) is a technical analysis indicator that measures the strength of a trend by comparing a security's closing price to its trading range and smoothing the results.
    It's based on the tendency for prices to close higher than they open in uptrends and to close lower than they open in downtrends.
